# Iterative Processing Using Spark

1. Implemented PageRank algorithm on Twitter dataset to rank each user by their influence.
2. Utilized Spark and Zeppelin notebook with Scala language for computation.
3. Optimized the PageRank by tuning parameters such as executor-memory, executor-cores, num-executors and so on.
4. Implemented same solution on Azure Databricks for auto optimization.

1. Implemented a Machine Learning solution to predict the cab fare price based on various parameters.
2. Cleaned outliers or missing values from the dataset according to data visualization.
3. Utilized XGBoost algorithm to train the ML model.
4. Used Google Vertex AI to train and tune the model. Also performed hyperparameter tuning.
5. Incorporated Google App Engine to deploy web application endpoint for accepting parameters and returning cab fare.
6. Implemented an application to accept speech containing parameters like user location and destination and return cab fare in the form of speech.
7. Implemented a solution by training a Vertex AI AutoML model using restaurant image. This solution is then used to predict fare based on images of source and destination locations.
